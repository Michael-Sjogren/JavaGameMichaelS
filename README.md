# JavaFX-2d-game

### A javafx 2d game with basic platforming aspects.

Just a simple game made in javafx with rectangular collision detection and gravity.

#### **Instructions**

##### **SPACE : jump**

##### **W : up**

##### **A : left**

##### **S : down**

##### **D : right**


I've also been working on implementing code to read savefiles from the program:  
[Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/ "Tiled Map Editor")
in Json format to generate tiles and collision objects.

Only orthogonal maps are compatible , and one tileset per file.
